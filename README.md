# Elevator Algorithm Offilne: 
# Algorithm offline:
 an offline algorithm is given the whole problem data from the beginning and is required to output an answer which solves the problem at hand.
# Algorthim online:
An online algorithm is one that can process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion, i.e., in the order that the input is fed to the algorithm, without having the entire input available from the beginning.
# My algorithm:
is working with algorithm offline that is the algorithm have all the data form the beginnig.
# How my algorithm work:
